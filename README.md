# Network Watchdog
 Network Watchdog is a simple watchdog for monitoring network connectivity and power cycle a device based on ICMP ping replies. 
 
 ## Functionality
- Powered from the controlled Device (usually a wifi repeater or access point)
- Can be used both in local and public networks.
- Ping is working both for IP Addresses and URLs.
- Redundancy functionality using secondary address.
- Manual restart of the controlled Device using the Web Interface or the built-in button.
- Configuration Reset Switch (Keep Restart button pressed for 3 seconds)

## Web Interface
When you finish uploading the code to ESP8266-01 and deploy the circuit, you can configure the device by navigating to http://nm-wd.local or finding the IP of the device using your router's web interface.

After the initial configuration you have to restart your Watchdog in order to connect to your WiFi network as a client. The Watchdog will deploy a webserver with information and more functionality at the same URL (http://nm-wd.local or the device's IP)
